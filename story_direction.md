# New Story Direction: The Matching Problem & Business Value

## Executive Summary
Our narrative is shifting from the mechanics of "prediction markets" or "headhunting" to the **Business Value of Efficient Matching**. We are not just another recruiting network; we are an incentive structure that solves the signal-to-noise problem in hiring.

## The Core Problem
- **Resume Parsing is Broken:** Traditional recruiters and platforms rely on weak proxies like "School" or "Former Company" because they cannot parse the actual story of a candidate.
- **The "Vibe" Gap:** There is no existing incentive mechanism to verify if a candidate truly understands a company's specific problems, philosophy, and work environment before the interview stage.

## The Solution: Market-Driven Pre-Interviewing
Instead of "outbound" spam, we use a market mechanism to **pre-interview** candidates.
- **Incentivized Curiosity:** Participants (recruiters, peers, experts) are financially incentivized to ask the *right* questions—the ones that reveal true competency and fit.
- **Belief Aggregation:** We use prediction markets not as the product, but as the **engine** to aggregate beliefs and allocate rewards. If you add information (truth) to the system, you get paid. If you are wrong, you lose.
- **Forcing Function for Clarity:** If a job description is vague, the market will query it. This feedback loop ensures that what is being looked for is clearly defined and understood.

## Business Value (The Focus)
This is what we communicate to customers. The mechanism is secondary to these results:

### 1. Efficiency & Speed
- **Pre-Validated Candidates:** The market filters candidates before they ever reach your desk.
- **Metrics that Matter:**
    - Reduce interviews per hire by **XX%**.
    - Decrease time-to-hire by **Y weeks**.
    - Reduce churn by **Z%** (better upfront alignment).

### 2. Quality & Discovery (The "Alpha")
- **Find Undervalued Talent:** The market can identify candidates who lack traditional credentials (e.g., Ivy League degrees) but have the specific evidence and ability to solve your problems.
- **The "Discount":** Hire high-performing talent that traditional filters miss, potentially at a lower cost basis because the market has validated their actual skill set, not just their pedigree.

### 3. Aligned Incentives
- **Skin in the Game:** Unlike traditional recruiters who get paid for placement regardless of long-term fit, our market participants lose money if they bet on the wrong candidate. This aligns the market's incentives with the company's long-term success.

## Key Narrative Shifts

| From (Avoid) | To (Emphasize) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "We are a prediction market for hiring." | "We solve the matching problem by incentivizing the market to pre-validate candidates." |
| "Headhunting with more steps." | "Pre-interviewing at scale." |
| "Betting on people." | "Aggregating beliefs to find the truth about candidate fit." |
| Focus on the *How* (Tokens, Markets) | Focus on the *Value* (Speed, Quality, Retention) |
